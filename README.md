# Giorgi Chagelishvili Portfolio Website

I am pleased to present my first project in Flask, which is my personal portfolio webpage. Developing a website where people can view my work, read about me, and find my contact information has been a goal of mine for some time. However, previous attempts did not meet my expectations.

Determined to overcome these challenges, I invested time and effort into enhancing my skills and knowledge. I decided to take on the project once again, this time utilizing Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. I am proud to say that the results exceeded my expectations.

The website showcases my experience, goals, and motivations. Additionally, users can easily reach out to me through the site. While I acknowledge that in the future, I may look back and laugh at my early attempts, for now, I am more than satisfied with the results of this project.
